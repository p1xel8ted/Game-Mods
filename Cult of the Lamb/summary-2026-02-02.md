# Summary - 02/02/2026

## Current Task
Fix infinite loop bug in TraitControl when using Re-educate or Re-indoctrinate with restricted trait weights.

## Goal
Prevent game freeze when user sets most trait weights to 0, leaving only a few traits with non-zero weights.

## Recent Changes Made

### TraitControl v0.1.5 - Infinite Loop Fix

**Problem:**
When users configured trait weights with most traits set to 0 (e.g., only Lustful, Polyamorous, and Jerk enabled), the game would freeze during Re-educate or Re-indoctrinate actions. The BepInEx console showed endless repetition of trait selection logs.

**Root Cause:**
The vanilla game's `FollowerInfo.RandomisedTraits()` method has a `do...while` loop that keeps calling `GetStartingTrait()` until it finds a trait NOT already in the results list. The mod's `SelectWeightedTrait()` had no awareness of which traits were already selected in the current session. After the few enabled traits were assigned, it kept returning the same traits, causing the vanilla loop condition to never be satisfied.

**Solution:**
Added session-level tracking (`_traitsAssignedThisSession` HashSet) to exclude already-assigned traits during the current follower's trait generation:

1. Added `_traitsAssignedThisSession` field to track assigned traits per session
2. Added `ResetSessionTracking()` method to clear tracking between followers
3. Modified `SelectWeightedTrait()` to skip traits already in the session set
4. Modified `GetRandomTrait()` to exclude session traits
5. Added warning log when trait pool is exhausted (helps users understand why they get fewer traits than configured)
6. Reset session tracking before Re-indoctrinate and Re-educate trait generation

## Files Modified

- `TraitControl/Patches/TraitWeights.cs` - Added session tracking, modified trait selection methods
- `TraitControl/TraitControl.csproj` - Version bump to 0.1.5
- `TraitControl/Plugin.cs` - Version bump to 0.1.5
- `Thunderstore/traitcontrol/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.1.5
- `Thunderstore/traitcontrol/CHANGELOG.md` - Added 0.1.5 entry

## Key Decisions

- Used HashSet for O(1) lookup when checking if trait was already assigned
- Added user-facing warning log when trait pool exhausted (actionable advice to enable more traits)
- Followed existing pattern (`_guaranteedTraitGivenThisSession`) for session-level state tracking

## Open Issues/Bugs
None currently known.

## Testing Notes
To verify the fix:
1. Set all trait weights to 0 except for 3 traits (e.g., Lustful, Polyamorous, Jerk)
2. Use Re-educate on an existing follower → should complete without freezing
3. Use Re-indoctrinate on an existing follower → should complete without freezing
4. Check BepInEx console for warning about trait pool exhaustion
