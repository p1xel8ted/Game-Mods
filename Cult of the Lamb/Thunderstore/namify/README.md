# Namify!

* Gets a random list of 2000 names from the randommer.io API for use when naming followers.
* The initial list is saved to a file where your save games are located to prevent having to make a request every time you start the game.
* Names are removed from the list as they are used to prevent duplicates.
* The provided API key is limited to 1000 requests per day. If you want to use your own API key, you can get one from [randommer.io](https://randommer.io/).
* Add your own names to the list by editing the json file or by using the interface via F1. The file is saved unencrypted to allow users to edit the file themselves.
* Namified names will display an asterix at the end of the name. Once the name is confirmed, the asterix is removed automatically.

## Recommendation

While not a hard requirement, I recommend you install [Unity Debugger Assistant](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/LethalCompanyModding/UnityDebuggerAssistant/) which allows for better log files when an exception happens because of a mod, which means I have more information to work with when bug reports are posted.

## Installation

* Install [BepInExPack CultOfTheLamb](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb/)
* Install [Configuration Manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/p1xel8ted/BepInEx_Configuration_Manager/)
* Place the plugin DLLs into your "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\plugins" folder. Either run the game, or create it if it doesn't exist.

## Configuration

* The configuration file is generated when you first run the game with the mod enabled. It can be found in the "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\config" folder.
* Press F1 in game to open the configuration manager. If you're in a dungeon, pause the game first otherwise the cursor doesn't work.
