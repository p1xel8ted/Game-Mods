## Mystic Assistant Redux

A continuation of [Ciarenni's Mystic Assistant](https://github.com/Ciarenni/COTL_MysticAssistant) mod, updated for the latest game version.

Buy specific rewards from the Mystic Shop instead of spinning the wheel. All agency, no RNG.

## Features

After beating the base game, visit the Mystic Shop and use the **secondary interaction** for "Mystic Assistant" to open the shop.

### Available Items (configurable God Tear cost, default 1)
- All 6 necklace types (Dark, Light, Gold Skull, Demonic, Loyalty, Missionary)
- Crystal Doctrine Stones (up to 24, or 28 with Woolhaven DLC)
- Talisman Pieces (up to 12)
- Follower Skins (random from unlockable pool)
- Decorations (random from unlockable pool)
- Tarot Cards (random from unlockable pool)
- Relics (random from unlockable pool)
- Black Gold (100 coins per purchase)

### Exclusive Content
- 5 Apple Arcade follower skins, 2 clothing items, 1 fleece, 5 decorations

### Optional Content (Config)
The following items are disabled by default since they're obtainable through normal gameplay. Enable them in the configuration manager under "Extra Content":
- 5 Woolhaven DLC necklaces (Death's Door, Winter, Frozen, Targeted, Weird) — requires Woolhaven DLC
- 31 boss follower skins — normally unlocked by defeating bosses

### God Tear Cost
The cost per item is configurable (1-10, default 1). Increasing the cost requires confirmation and is locked per save — it can only go up, never down. The cost can only be changed while a save is loaded. The lock is automatically cleared when a save is deleted or overwritten.

### Overbuy Warnings
The shop will warn you before purchasing items beyond their normal limits (talisman pieces, dark/light necklaces). Click again to confirm.
