# Quick Menus

Hotkey-based quick access to four game menus from anywhere - no need to be at the base.

## Menus

| Default Key | Menu | Description |
|---|---|---|
| F2 | Follower Forms | Browse your follower skin collection |
| F3 | Structures | View available structures (browse-only) |
| F4 | Clothing | Browse and assign clothing to followers |
| F5 | Fleeces | View, equip, and customize fleeces |

## Features

- **Toggle hotkeys** - Press to open, press again to close
- **Quick switch** - Press a different hotkey while a menu is open to switch directly
- **Works anywhere** - Open menus from the base, dungeons, or anywhere else
- **Configurable** - Rebind all hotkeys and enable/disable each menu individually
- **Localized** - Configuration UI and menu titles translated in all 15 supported languages

## Installation

* Install [BepInExPack CultOfTheLamb](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb/)
* Install [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/p1xel8ted/BepInEx_Configuration_Manager/) (for in-game configuration)
* Place the plugin DLL into your "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\plugins" folder.

## Configuration

All menus are enabled by default. Edit the config file in `BepInEx/config/` or use Configuration Manager (F1) to configure in-game.

### Hotkeys
- **Follower Forms** - Default: F2
- **Build Menu** - Default: F3
- **Tailor / Clothing** - Default: F4
- **Player Upgrades / Fleeces** - Default: F5

### Toggles
Each menu hotkey can be individually enabled or disabled.

## Notes

- The Structures menu is browse-only — you cannot place buildings from it
- Fleece customization (left/right to change variants) works while the menu is paused
- The Clothing menu works even without a Tailor building
