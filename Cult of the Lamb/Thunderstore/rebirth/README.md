# Rebirth

* Followers can be reborn, allowing you to change their names, looks etc.
* First one is free; subsequent ones on the same follower require Rebirth Tokens obtained from crusading (default 25, configurable).
* Source of the tokens is from killing enemies, destroying old bone piles, dungeon chests, offering shrines, and more.
* The drop chance defaults to 5% (configurable).
* The followers' XP carries over, but there is a 20% chance they lose some XP when reborn (configurable). There is a notification when this happens.
* Their old body stays; compost it, eat it. Up to you.
* Refine the tokens at your refineries from bones (default 15, configurable)!
* Send your followers on a mission to get tokens!
* Go on a quest yourself to get tokens!
* All values are configurable via the in-game mod settings menu or the BepInEx config file.
