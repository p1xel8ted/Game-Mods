[size=4][b]Recommendation[/b][/size]

[size=3]While not a hard requirement, I recommend you install [url=https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/LethalCompanyModding/UnityDebuggerAssistant/]Unity Debugger Assistant[/url] which allows for better log files when an exception happens because of a mod, which means I have more information to work with when bug reports are posted.[/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cultofthelamb/mods/31]Cult of the Lamb BepInEx 5 Pack[/url][/size]
