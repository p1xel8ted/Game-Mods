### 2.0.0 - 8/10/2022

* Weather is a little more dynamic. Don't get excited, there ain't any snow.
* Four config options for weather. Low range and high range for both rain and wind. Low range = light rain/wind, high range = heavy rain/wind. When the game changes weather, it basically rolls 0-100. Default config is:
- Low range rain = 0-15, meaning the roll has to fall between those numbers for it to rain lightly.
- High range rain = 85-100, meaning the roll has to fall between those numbers for it to rain heavily.
- Low range wind = 0-25, meaning the roll has to fall between those numbers for it to be light winds.
- High range wind = 75-100, meaning the roll has to fall between those numbers for it to be high winds.
* Notifications (on/off) for when the days phase changes, i.e. morning, noon, evening, night, etc.
* Notifications (on/off) for when the weather changes, i.e. light rain, heavy rain, wind, etc.
* Hopefully fixed a bug where buildings could vanish from the map when uing propaganda speaker mods.
* By default, the game changes weather when you exit a building or start a new day. You can now set it to change weather when the time of day changes, i.e. morning, noon, evening, night, etc.

* Implemented a potential fix for speakers not turning back on.
* Added ability to replaced follower necklaces. The one they're wearing will drop to the ground.

### 1.8.0 - 11/09/2022 - Some options have moved categories, I suggest a clean config file.

* Lumberjack stations now have their loot speed delay lowered when collecting from the chest. Its not totally 0 (its 0.01), because it makes the animations look like junk.

* Added option to disable the game over mechanic (user request).
* Added option to increase lifespan of lumber/mines by 50%, as 100% felt way too long.
* After being inspired with inspire all, any remaining glowy eyed followers should now level as well.

* Inspire All "should" be fixed now.
* Added option to double lumber/mine stations age instead of only lasting forever.
* Removed anything outhouse related as they're being put into a separate outhouse specific mod.
* WIP - Option to double the storage capacity of shrines (not quite done, the main one ignores it for some reason).

### 1.5.0 - 02/09/2022

* Collection delays from the main shrine (credits to Matthew-X), the smaller shrines, the chest near the portal, the outhouses and the beds have been reduced to zero, otherwise shortened (otherwise animations look like junk).
* The seed and fertilizer silos can be expanded to 32 slots, which is the number of plots you can build around them. (credits to Matthew-X).
* Further adjustments to Inspire All - I have not found a consistent way to reproduce the issue. If it occurs (stand there dancing), save, exit to the menu and go back in.

### 1.4.0

* Made some adjustments to the outhouse stuff, see how it goes. Still a WIP.
* Added game speed manipulation. Left/Right arrows to increase/decrease in 0.25 increments. Up arrow resets it to default. Maximum (artifical cap) is 5, and good luck to you playing it at that speed.

* Added option to cure illness/exhaustion when a follower gains loyalty (the floaty white eyes thing).
* Fixed refinery config not being there.
* More

### 1.1

* Collect tithes/inspire all at once. Inspire has some quirks I'm working on.
* Reverse the 200% golden fleece cap.
* Double the rate the damage increases with the golden fleece.
