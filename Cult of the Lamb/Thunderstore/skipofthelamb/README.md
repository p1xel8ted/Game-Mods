# Skip of the Lamb

A simple mod to skip splash screens and the crown video in Cult of the Lamb. Created at user request.

## Features

- **Skip Intros** - Skip the developer splash screens on game start
- **Skip Crown Video** - Skip the video when the lamb gets given the crown

## Compatibility

Works in harmony with [Cult of QoL](https://cult-of-the-lamb.thunderstore.io/package/p1xel8ted/CultOfQoL/) if installed. CultOfQoL's skip intro/video features will be automatically disabled in favor of this mod's settings.

## Configuration

All features are disabled by default. Edit the config file in `BepInEx/config/` or install [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://cult-of-the-lamb.thunderstore.io/package/p1xel8ted/BepInEx_Configuration_Manager/) to configure in-game with F1.
