[/list]

[size=4][b]Recommendation[/b][/size]

[size=3]While not a hard requirement, I recommend you install [url=https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/LethalCompanyModding/UnityDebuggerAssistant/]Unity Debugger Assistant[/url] which allows for better log files when an exception happens because of a mod, which means I have more information to work with when bug reports are posted.[/size]

[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cultofthelamb/mods/31]Cult of the Lamb BepInEx 5 Pack[/url][/size]
[*][size=3]Optionally install [url=https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/p1xel8ted/BepInEx_Configuration_Manager/]Configuration Manager[/url] for in-game configuration with F1.[/size]
[*][size=3]Place the plugin DLL into your "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\plugins" folder. Either run the game, or create it if it doesn't exist.[/size]
[/list]

[size=4][b]Configuration[/b][/size]

[size=3]All features are disabled by default.[/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]The configuration file is generated when you first run the game with the mod enabled. It can be found in the "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\config" folder.[/size]
[*][size=3]If you have Configuration Manager installed, press F1 in game to configure. If you're in a dungeon, pause the game first otherwise the cursor doesn't work.[/size]
