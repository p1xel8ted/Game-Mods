[size=3][i]Originally part of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cultofthelamb/mods/1]Cult of QoL[/url], these trait features grew substantial enough to deserve their own dedicated mod.[/i][/size]

[size=4][b]Features[/b][/size]

[size=3][b]Trait Replacement[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3]Automatically replaces negative traits with positive ones on all followers (existing and new).[/size]
[*][size=3]Backs up original traits and can restore them if the feature is disabled.[/size]
[*][size=3]Option to use only unlocked traits for replacements.[/size]
[*][size=3]Option to pull from all trait pools instead of the game's separate pools.[/size]
[*][size=3]Exclusive traits (like Lazy/Industrious) can be replaced with their counterpart or a random trait.[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Unique Traits[/b][/size]
[size=3]Control whether special/crossover traits can appear in trait pools:[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Immortal[/b] - normally a special reward[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Disciple[/b] - normally a special reward[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Dont Starve[/b] - crossover trait (follower doesn't need to eat)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Blind[/b] - crossover trait[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Born To The Rot[/b] - crossover trait[/size]
[/list]

[size=3]Each unique trait has two options:[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Include[/b] - allows the trait to appear in trait pools[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Guarantee[/b] - new followers will always receive this trait (ignores weights). Only one follower can have this trait unless "Allow Multiple Unique Traits" is enabled.[/size]
[/list]

[size=3]Additional option:[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Allow Multiple Unique Traits[/b] - normally only one follower can have each unique/single-use trait (Immortal, Disciple, Lazy, Snorer, etc.). Enable this to allow multiple followers to have the same trait.[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Trait Count[/b][/size]
[size=3]Control how many traits followers receive:[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Minimum Traits[/b] (2-8) - the minimum number of traits a new follower will have[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Maximum Traits[/b] (2-8) - the maximum number of traits a new follower will have[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Randomize Traits on Re-indoctrination[/b] - when re-indoctrinating at the altar, randomize traits (vanilla only changes appearance/name)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Trait Reroll via Reeducation[/b] - adds the Re-educate command to normal followers to re-roll their traits using your configured settings[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Trait Weights (Trait Probability Control)[/b][/size]
[size=3]Control how likely each trait is to appear on new followers. Each trait has a weight slider from 0 to 100. Weights are relative to each other.[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Higher weight = more likely relative to other traits[/b][/size]
[*][size=3][b]Lower weight = less likely relative to other traits[/b][/size]
[*][size=3][b]Weight of 0 = disabled[/b] - that trait will never appear[/size]
[*][size=3]All traits default to 1.0 (equal chance).[/size]
[*][size=3]Sliders snap to 0.05 increments for precise control (values below 0.1 snap to 0).[/size]
[/list]
[size=3]The trait list is dynamically generated from the game, so new traits added by the developers will automatically appear in the config.[/size]

[size=3][b]Localization Support[/b][/size]
[size=3]Trait names display in your current game language alongside the internal name, e.g. "Lover of Cold (Chionophile)". Names update automatically when you change languages. Traits with missing translations are marked with an asterisk (*), indicating they are not fully implemented in the game itself.[/size]

[size=3][b]Trait Categories[/b][/size]
[size=3]Each trait in the configuration shows category tags indicating which game lists it belongs to. This helps you understand which traits are safe to disable without affecting unlocks.[/size]

[list]
[*][size=3][b]Starting[/b] - Naturally appears on new followers (default pool)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Rare[/b] - 20% chance to appear instead of a third starting trait[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Faithful[/b] - Granted when a follower becomes faithful (spider web interaction)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Unique[/b] - Special reward traits - only one follower can have each (Immortal, Disciple, etc.)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Single[/b] - Only one follower in your cult can have this trait at a time[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Sin[/b] - Sin traits (requires Pleasure Shrine from Sins of the Flesh DLC)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]DLC[/b] - Requires DLC content to be active[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Winter[/b] - Winter/seasons-specific traits[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Event[/b] - Granted through gameplay events (marriage, parenting, criminal, etc.)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Unlock[/b] - Requires at least one boss defeated[/size]
[/list]
[size=3]Traits can belong to multiple categories. For example, [b][Single, Starting][/b] means the trait appears in the starting pool but only one follower can have it.[/size]

[size=3][b]Excluded Traits[/b][/size]
[size=3]Some traits are excluded from the weights list because they require special game state or are granted through gameplay events:[/size]

[/list]

[size=3][b]Notifications[/b][/size]
[size=3]Optional notifications when trait replacement adds or removes traits.[/size]

[size=3][b]Reset Settings[/b][/size]
[size=3]Reset all configuration options to their default values (vanilla game behavior) with a single click. Found in section "07. Reset Settings" in the Configuration Manager.[/size]
