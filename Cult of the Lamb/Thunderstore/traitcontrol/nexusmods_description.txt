[size=4][b]Trait Weights (Trait Probability Control)[/b][/size]

[size=3]Control how likely each trait is to appear on new followers. Each trait has a weight slider from 0 to 10.[/size]

[size=3][b]How it works:[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Higher weight = more likely to appear[/b] - Want more Faithful followers? Slide it up to 5 or 10.[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Lower weight = less likely[/b] - Don't want Materialistic followers? Slide it down.[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Weight of 0 = disabled[/b] - That trait will never appear on new followers.[/size]
[*][size=3]All traits default to 1.0 (equal chance).[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Examples:[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3]Set "Faithful" to 5.0, leave others at 1.0 → Faithful is 5x more likely than other traits[/size]
[*][size=3]Set "Materialistic" to 0 → Materialistic will never appear[/size]
[*][size=3]Set all negative traits to 0, positive traits to 10 → Only positive traits will appear[/size]
[/list]
