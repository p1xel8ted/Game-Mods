[size=3][i]Originally part of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cultofthelamb/mods/1]Cult of QoL[/url], these trait features grew substantial enough to deserve their own dedicated mod.[/i][/size]

[size=4][b]Features[/b][/size]

[size=3][b]Trait Replacement[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3]Automatically replaces negative traits with positive ones on all followers (existing and new).[/size]
[*][size=3]Backs up original traits and can restore them if the feature is disabled.[/size]
[*][size=3]Option to use only unlocked traits for replacements.[/size]
[*][size=3]Option to pull from all trait pools instead of the game's separate pools.[/size]
[*][size=3]Exclusive traits (like Lazy/Industrious) can be replaced with their counterpart or a random trait.[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Unique Traits[/b][/size]
[size=3]Control whether special/crossover traits can appear in trait pools:[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Immortal[/b] - normally a special reward[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Disciple[/b] - normally a special reward[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Dont Starve[/b] - crossover trait (follower doesn't need to eat)[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Blind[/b] - crossover trait[/size]
[*][size=3][b]Born To The Rot[/b] - crossover trait[/size]
[/list]

[size=3][b]Trait Weights (Trait Probability Control)[/b][/size]
[size=3]Control how likely each trait is to appear on new followers. Each trait has a weight slider from 0 to 10. Weights are relative to each other - a trait with weight 10 is 10x more likely to appear than a trait with weight 1.[/size]
[list]
[*][size=3][b]Higher weight = more likely relative to other traits[/b][/size]
[*][size=3][b]Lower weight = less likely relative to other traits[/b][/size]
[*][size=3][b]Weight of 0 = disabled[/b] - that trait will never appear[/size]
[*][size=3]All traits default to 1.0 (equal chance).[/size]
[/list]
[size=3]The trait list is dynamically generated from the game, so new traits added by the developers will automatically appear in the config.[/size]

[size=3][b]Notifications[/b][/size]
[size=3]Optional notifications when trait replacement adds or removes traits.[/size]

[size=4][b]Configuration Examples[/b][/size]

[size=3][b]"I want all followers to have only positive traits"[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3]Enable Trait Replacement: ON[/size]
[*][size=3]Use Unlocked Traits Only: OFF[/size]
[*][size=3]Prefer Exclusive Counterparts: ON[/size]
[/list]
[size=3][i]Result: All negative traits are replaced. Lazy becomes Industrious, Faithless becomes Faithful, etc.[/i][/size]

[size=3][b]"I want to allow Immortal trait on new followers"[/b][/size]
[list]
[*][size=3]Use All Traits Pool: ON[/size]
[*][size=3]Include Immortal: ON[/size]

[*][size=3]Enable Trait Weights: ON[/size]
[*][size=3]Faithful (in Good Traits): 5.0[/size]
[*][size=3]Other traits: 1.0 (default)[/size]
[/list]
[size=3][i]Result: Faithful is 5x more likely to appear than other traits on new followers. Note: Faithful is only in the Rare pool by default, so "Use All Traits Pool" is needed for it to appear on regular new followers.[/i][/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Enable Trait Replacement: ON[/size]
[*][size=3]Prefer Exclusive Counterparts: OFF[/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Use All Traits Pool: ON[/size]

[/list]
[size=3][i]Result: Existing Lazy followers become Industrious. New followers are much more likely to be Industrious and will never be Lazy. Note: Industrious is not in the default trait pools, so "Use All Traits Pool" is needed for weighting to work.[/i][/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Use All Traits Pool: ON[/size]
[*][size=3]Include Immortal: ON[/size]

[list]
[*][size=3]Enable Trait Replacement: OFF[/size]
[*][size=3]Enable Trait Weights: ON[/size]
