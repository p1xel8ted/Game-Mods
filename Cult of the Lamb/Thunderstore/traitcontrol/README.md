# Trait Control

Control your followers' traits with this quality-of-life mod.

*Originally part of [Cult of QoL](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/p1xel8ted/Cult_of_QoL_Collection/), these trait features grew substantial enough to deserve their own dedicated mod.*

## Features

### No Negative Traits
- Automatically replaces negative traits with positive ones when followers are created
- Backs up original traits and can restore them if feature is disabled
- Configurable options for which traits to include (Immortal, Disciple, unlocked traits only)

### Trait Weights (Trait Probability Control)
Control how likely each trait is to appear on new followers. Each trait has a weight slider from 0 to 10.

**How it works:**
- **Higher weight = more likely to appear** - Want more Faithful followers? Slide it up to 5 or 10.
- **Lower weight = less likely** - Don't want Materialistic followers? Slide it down.
- **Weight of 0 = disabled** - That trait will never appear on new followers.
- All traits default to 1.0 (equal chance).

**Examples:**
- Set "Faithful" to 5.0, leave others at 1.0 → Faithful is 5x more likely than other traits
- Set "Materialistic" to 0 → Materialistic will never appear
- Set all negative traits to 0, positive traits to 10 → Only positive traits will appear

The trait list is dynamically generated from the game, so new traits added by the developers will automatically appear in the config.
